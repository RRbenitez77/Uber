# Uber
2016 Data of Uber trips. I started with reorganizing the CSV data document. I then sanitized the data of null data. The purpose of the  data exploration was to ask the data what types of trips mostly are made with Uber and by uber customers. The data displayed 
that a resounding amout of the trips are for business over personal however many trips are made on fridays in after hours and on weekends. I used Seaborn tools were utilized for data visualization in a bar chart to communicate data recomendations.
